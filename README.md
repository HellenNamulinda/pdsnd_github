# Exploring US Bikeshare Data Project  
Using python to analyze bikeshare data from three US cities.

## Project Overview:

This project focusses on the use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. 
Pandas library and statistics methods are used to perform a rudimentary analysis on this data - to display information such as most popular days or most common stations.

## Requirements:

* Language: Python 3.8 or above 
* Libraries: pandas, numpy
* N.B: All these were installed using Anaconda.

## Project Data (Files used):

* chicago.csv, new_york_city.csv and washington.csv - These dataset files contain all bikeshare information for the citities of Chicago, New York City and Washington respectively. All these files were provided by Udacity.
 
* Note: washington.csv does not include the 'Gender' and 'Birth Year' data.

## Running the program:
To run the program , I use Anaconda's command prompt on a Windows 10 machine. You enter the command 'python bikeshare.py' on the terminal.


## Credits
* [Udacity](https://udacity.com) - Udacity's Nanodegree program of Python for Data Science with Python and their instructors were extremely helpful.
* [Aritra Chattaraj](https://github.com/aritra96)  - Aritra's repository inspired me and helped to better understand the structure for this project.
* [pandas docs](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/) - pandas documentation was helpful in understanding the pandas methods used in this project.
